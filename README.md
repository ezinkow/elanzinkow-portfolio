## About This Project:

This was a homework assignment as part of the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp to build the beginnings of my own website that would contain an "About Me" page, a "Portfolio" page, and a "Contact" page.

This website was built with Bootstrap, HTML and CSS.

## Summary of Project:

The website is built with code from the website Bootstrap. It uses a Bootstrap navbar and its prebuilt grid, columns and rows to lay out the site.

It is to have fully functioning links, a working navbar, an image of myself and filled out "About Me" with links to social media.

It also needs to have a responsive design for different sized windows and devices so that it will look normal on computers, tablets and phones.
The responsive design breaks need to match examples given at screen sizes of 400px, 768px and 992px for each page within the website.
