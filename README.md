## About This Project:

This was a homework assignment as part of the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp to build a full working portfolio page to display projects, contact info and skills to potential empoyers.

This website was built with Bootstrap, BootstrapMade, Boxicons, Owl Carousel, HTML and CSS.

## Summary of Project:

My portfolio website was built with a template from the website BootstrapMade, which uses Bootstrap as its main CSS framework, along with other vendors to create icons, carousels and more.

The website includes links to my GitHub, Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn pages. It contains an about me area with contact info and links to my video producer website and reel, and a skills and abilities section.
There is also a small portion of my resume along with a link to download it.
Below that are links, with screen shots, of projects and apps that I've created so far as part of the Coding Bootcamp.
